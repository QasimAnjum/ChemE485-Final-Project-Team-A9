Planning reports must include:

1. A short abstract describing the process.

2. Hand-written block flow diagram of the process.

3. Initial data regarding the reaction kinetics necessary for simulations

4. A suggested thermodynamics package and any extra information that needs to be gathered for the simulation

5. An order of magnitude estimate of the design cost.
